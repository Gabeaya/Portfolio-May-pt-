    <h2>About Gabe</h2>
    <p>Hello there! My name is Gabriel and I am a striving developer. Once a California native, I now am seeking refuge from hot winters and bad drivers in eastern Washington. I spent my childhood kicking around a soccer ball and getting into trouble. I always had dreams of being a professional athlete but the universes plans take precendence over my aspirations. "You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather." I have had a handful of jobs: Soccer referee, Qualcomm fry cook, landscaper, hotel management, laborer to carpenter, and more recently a stay at home maid. I have learned many lessons from these jobs, making wonderful friends along the way, but have no intentions of looking back as my eyes are set on my developing prospects.  </p>
