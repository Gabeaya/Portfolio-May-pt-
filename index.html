        <h2>About Gabe</h2>
        <p>Hello there! My name is Gabriel and I am a striving developer. Once a California native, I now am seeking refuge from hot winters and bad drivers in eastern Washington. I spent my childhood kicking around a soccer ball and getting into trouble. I always had dreams of being a professional athlete but the universes plans take precendence over my aspirations. "You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather." I have had a handful of jobs: Soccer referee, Qualcomm fry cook, landscaper, hotel management, laborer to carpenter, and more recently a stay at home maid. I have learned many lessons from these jobs, making wonderful friends along the way, but have no intentions of looking back as my eyes are set on my developing prospects. Programming is like learning to speak computer and everyone knows you're more likely to be successful if you're bilingual. This course is just the beginning of an endless horizon and I'd like to eventually be able to freelance while roadtripping across the world and continuing to pursue art and all nature has to offer. </p>
